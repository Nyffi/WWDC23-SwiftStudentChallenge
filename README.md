# Coven (WWDC23 Swift Student Challenge Project)
Coven is a game for iPad developed using SpriteKit for the WWDC 2023's Swift Student Challenge.

## The Goal
The goal of the project was to show the potential that games have for teaching and training by training the player's reflexes, visuomotor (hand-eye) coordination, attention span, strategic decisions, etc.
The goal of the game is to dodge all the projectiles while defeating enemies and dealing as much damage as possible to the boss.

## About the Author and the Project
Hey there, my name is Paulo CÃ©sar, and I am a Software Engineering graduated at the Catholic University of Brasilia, and also graduated at the Developer Academy/UCB, in Brazil.

My desire when creating the idea for this project, was to make a game that recreated the challenge and  gameplay aspects of a popular game franchise i enjoy called Touhou Project, made by a single-man company called Team Shanghai Alice owned by ZUN. I also wanted to give the player a good challenge to have their skills tested out to its fullest capacity, while still having fun, in a non-obvious way.

I believe that games have a huge potential of being used for educational and training purposes, even when that is not the main goal of the game. You can think of any video game in the world, regardless of theme, gameplay or story, they will always teach or train something, the most common being hand-eye coordination.
